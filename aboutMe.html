            <p>My name is Adrian, and I am a  software engineer. I am currently a student at Code Fellows pursuing an education in computer programming. I decided to take my love of learning challenging material and my interest in technology to pursue an education in programming. <br /> I grew up as an artist, and I believe that my love of drawing and creativity allows me to understand how to layout a beautiful website. I have worked in retail for 7 years and this has given me a better understanding of what a customer wants. I can use that knowledge with future clients to design them a website that will fulfill their business needs.</p>

            <p>My name is Damian Angelidis, I am 18 years old, and I am a software developer. I have worked in the service industry for a year and a half, first at Panera Bread and then at Value Village. I chose  to learn Software Development because it has something I have been interested in, and pursued, since I was in the sixth grade.  I picked up this skill again because I wanted to pursue a career that I was good at, genuinely interested in, and have plenty of opportunities for monetary success. My previous experience in computer science is a few summer camps in java, python, and 3D printing, as well as AP Computer Science class in my junior year.</p>

            <p>My name is James Dansie, and I'm a software developer at Code Fellows. Prior to software development I was a research engineer. I was highly specialize, but I felt pigeonholed and stagnant. I was using python at work to sort experimental data, and I enjoyed that more than my actual work. I decided to make it my career. <br /> I have absolutely loved going back to school to learn again! I am looking for a position where I can continue to learn and grow. In particular I would love a position where I can learn the backend more, and to work closely with an experienced mentor who can help guide my growth.</p>

            <p>Hi, my name is Julie Erlemeier and I am a software developer, harpist, and yoga instructor. I have a BS in Molecular and Cellular Biology and a background in women's health. <br /> I decided to learn software development because I am designing a women's health app that helps women prevent unplanned pregnancy.<br /> I picked Full-stack Javascript because I enjoy front-end development. Ideally, I will spend part of my time designing and part of my time coding. I want to use my skills in instruction, creativity, logic, and team-management to be a highly effective developer.
