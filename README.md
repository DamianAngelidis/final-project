  - If we were working on something
- Group-Only Standup: Take place right before lunch
- At the end of the day we would do a group talk about what we thought went well and what didn't

### Group Conflict Plan

1. Talk to the individual away from the group and try to talk it out
2. Talk with the whole group, bring up issues that group can work through together
3. Go to Lena and have her be an unbiased ear
